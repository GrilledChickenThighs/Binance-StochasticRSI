## Binance Stochastic RSI Indicator

This indicator was designed in python and operates as a standalone program, but can be integrated with an automated trading bot.

Currently it runs on python3 and prints to a log file every 30 seconds with calculated stochasticRSI metrics.

Normally, we would use ta-lib for these calculations, but Currently ta-libs stochrsi module is broken. I have created this as a quick fix until talib can be fixed.

Here is a sample of the data you will be getting.
